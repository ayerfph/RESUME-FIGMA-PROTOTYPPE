# Portfolio Prototype
## Info:
- I decide to create a prototype in figma for my Web Portfolio and will start to build in January 2025
- The portfolio highlights my past projects, certificates, educational backgrounds, core skills.
- The design is very minimalist (I preferred simple and minimal in my design)
- The prototype was created in FIGMA, during my time starting to learn about FIGMA.
